#' Compute the Nystuen and Dacey graph for a spatial interaction model
#'
#' This function computes the most important flows in a spatial interaction
#' model according to the approach outlined by J. D. Nystuen and M. F. Dacey
#' (Nystuen & Dacey, 1961. In this work, a *nodal flow* is the largest flow sent
#' from a non terminal location (based on the definition of terminals recalled
#' in [terminals()]). The *nodal structure* is the collection of those flows.
#' They form an oriented graph that has interesting properties. In particular
#' each weakly connected component contains a single terminal location which can
#' be seen as the dominant location of the component. Notice that because nodal
#' flows are based on terminals, this function applies only to the non bipartite
#' setting.
#'
#' In practice, the function computes first the terminals and non terminals
#' according to either Nystuen & Dacey (1961) or Rihll and Wilson (1991). Then
#' it extracts the nodal flows. The result of the analysis is returned as a data
#' frame with three columns:
#' -  `from`: the index of the non terminal origin location
#' -  `to`: the index of destination location of the nodal flow of `from`
#' -   `flow`: the value of the nodal flow
#'
#' An important aspect of the node structure is that is does not contain
#' isolated terminals. If a location is a terminal but is never the receiver of
#' a nodal flow it will not appear in the collection of nodal flows. It
#' constitutes a a trivial connected component in itself.
