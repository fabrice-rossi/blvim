</h3>
<p>Spatial interaction models aim to estimate flows between locations,
for instance, workers commuting from residential zones to employment
zones. Models are built from:</p>
<ul>
<li>A collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> origin
locations described by some characteristics <span class="math inline">\((X_i)_{1\leq i\leq n}\)</span>
</li>
<li>A collection of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> destination
locations described by some characteristics <span class="math inline">\((Z_j)_{1\leq j\leq p}\)</span>
</li>
<li>A collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\times p\)</span>
characteristics of the difficulty of travelling (in a broad sense) from
origin <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to destination <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c_{ij}\)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to estimate flows <span class="math inline">\((Y_{ij})_{1\leq i\leq n, 1\leq j\leq p}\)</span>
from origin locations to destination locations. A typical hypothesis is
for the flows to depend on characteristics as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_{ij}=f(X_i, Z_j, c_{ij}),
\]</span></p>
<p>for a well-chosen function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.
The most well-known spatial interaction model is the so-called
<em>gravity model</em>, which takes the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_{ij}\propto \frac{X_iZ_j}{c_{ij}^2},
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\propto\)</span> means proportional
to, <span class="math inline">\(c_{ij}\)</span> is supposed to be the
distance between origin <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and
destination <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, and the
characteristics <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z_j\)</span> are assumed to be numerical.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="constraints">Constraints<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#constraints"></a>
</h3>
<p>Spatial interaction models can be instantiated with different
constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>On production: the <span class="math inline">\((X_i)\)</span> are
interpreted as production values. Then the model is
<em>production-constrained</em> if <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{j=1}^pY_{ij}=X_i\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>;</li>
<li>On capacity: the <span class="math inline">\((Z_j)\)</span> are
interpreted as destination capacities. Then the model is
<em>capacity-constrained</em> if <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^pY_{ij}=Z_j\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>;</li>
<li>On both: the <em>doubly-constrained</em> models are both production-
and capacity-constrained. One of the most common models used in practice
is the doubly-constrained gravity model.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="maximum-entropy-models">Maximum Entropy Models<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#maximum-entropy-models"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the late 1960s, Alan Wilson developed a collection of spatial
interaction models based on a maximum entropy principle. In those
models, the flow is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_{ij} \propto X_iZ_j^{\alpha}\exp(-\beta c_{ij}),
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are two parameters interpreted as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a <em>return to
scale</em> parameter: if <span class="math inline">\(Z_j\)</span> grows
above <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, its actual attractiveness
can increase in a super-linear way (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha&gt;1\)</span>) or in a sub-linear way
(<span class="math inline">\(\alpha&lt;1\)</span>);</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> acts as the <em>inverse
of the scale of the costs</em> <span class="math inline">\(c_{ij}\)</span>. If those costs are distances, for
instance, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\beta}\)</span> can be
seen as a cut-off distance.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with other spatial interaction models, maximum entropy models are
constrained. In <code>blvim</code>, we focus on production-constrained
models and thus we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_{ij} = \frac{X_iZ_j^{\alpha}\exp(-\beta
c_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^pZ_k^{\alpha}\exp(-\beta c_{ik})},
\]</span></p>
<p>which ensures:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\forall i,\ \sum_{j=1}^pY_{ij}=X_i.
\]</span></p>
<p>This model is implemented in <code>blvim</code> by the
<code><a href="../reference/static_blvim.html">static_blvim()</a></code> function.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="dynamic-models">Dynamic Models<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dynamic-models"></a>
</h2>
<p>The models described above are <em>static</em>: they correspond to a
frozen view of the exchanges with no retroaction of the flow received at
one destination location on its attractiveness, for instance.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, Harris and Wilson developed dynamic models
that assume a form of etroaction, initially in terms of an equilibrium
state.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="harris-and-wilson-equilibrium-values">Harris and Wilson Equilibrium Values<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#harris-and-wilson-equilibrium-values"></a>
</h3>
<p>The main idea from Harris (1964) is that if we interpret incoming
flows as revenues, then the capacity/attractiveness of a destination
location should be adapted to those revenues (for production-constrained
models). Essentially, this could be written as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\forall j,\ Z_j=\kappa D_j,
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> is a conversion
factor between capacity and revenues, and where <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> is the total flow incoming in <span class="math inline">\(Z_j\)</span>, i.e.:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\forall j,\  D_j=\sum_{i=1}^nY_{ij}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Applied to the maximum entropy production-constrained model, this
leads to a spatial interaction model defined implicitly as follows. We
assume given the production constraints <span class="math inline">\((X_i)_{1\leq i\leq n}\)</span> and the cost matrix
<span class="math inline">\((c_{ij})_{1\leq i\leq n, 1\leq j\leq
p}\)</span>, then the attractiveness <span class="math inline">\((Z_j)_{1\leq j\leq p}\)</span> is a solution of
the following collection of fixed-point equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\forall
j,\  Z_j=\kappa\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{X_iZ_j^{\alpha}\exp(-\beta
c_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^pZ_k^{\alpha}\exp(-\beta c_{ik})}\right),
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> are fixed parameters.</p>
<p>From the <span class="math inline">\((Z_j)_{1\leq j\leq p}\)</span>,
the flows are computed using the standard production-constrained maximum
entropy model.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="a-dynamic-model-the-boltzmannlotkavolterra-model">A Dynamic Model: The Boltzmann–Lotka–Volterra Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-dynamic-model-the-boltzmannlotkavolterra-model"></a>
</h3>
<p>The collection of fixed-point equations can be solved using different
techniques, for instance, Newton’s method. The simplest solution is
probably to perform fixed-point iterations, as discussed in Harris &amp;
Wilson (1978). We start with some initial values of the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>s, denoted <span class="math inline">\((Z^{0}_j)_{1\leq j\leq p}\)</span>, and then
iterate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\forall j,\ Z_j^{t+1} :=
\kappa\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{X_i{(Z^{t}_j)}^{\alpha}\exp(-\beta
c_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^p{(Z^{t}_k)}^{\alpha}\exp(-\beta c_{ik})}\right),
\]</span></p>
<p>until convergence.</p>
<p>This iterative scheme can also be interpreted as a dynamic model in
which the attractiveness of a location is updated to match its incoming
flow. The update is not instantaneous, and thus an update parameter is
introduced, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. Then we start
again with some initial values of the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>s and then iterate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\forall j,\ D_j^{t} &amp;:=
\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{X_i{(Z^{t}_j)}^{\alpha}\exp(-\beta
c_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^p{(Z^{t}_k)}^{\alpha}\exp(-\beta c_{ik})}\right),\\
\forall j,\ Z_j^{t+1} &amp;:= Z_j^t +\epsilon(\kappa D^{t}_j-Z^{t}_j).
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Using <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon&lt;1\)</span>, typically a
small value of <span class="math inline">\(0.01\)</span>, gives a full
trajectory for the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>s with the
added value of preventing oscillation behaviour.</p>
<p>A variant of the dynamic model has been proposed by Wilson in 2008,
replacing the second update by a quadratic version:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\forall j,\ Z_j^{t+1} := Z_j^t +\epsilon(\kappa D^{t}_j-Z^{t}_j)Z^{t}_j.
\]</span></p>
<p>Both solutions are implemented in <code><a href="../reference/blvim.html">blvim()</a></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="diversity">Diversity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#diversity"></a>
</h3>
<p>A typical behaviour of the equilibrium solutions is a concentration
of the attractiveness on a subset of the destination locations. This can
be measured by the <code><a href="../reference/diversity.html">diversity()</a></code> function. It uses the notion
of diversity outlined in, for example, Jost (2006). The main idea of
this notion, rephrased in the context of locations, is to find from the
<span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>s an equivalent number of
locations, say <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, for which the
attractiveness would be evenly spread (that is, proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{m}\)</span>).</p>
<p>If we normalise the <span class="math inline">\((Z_j)_{1\leq j\leq
p}\)</span> such that they sum to 1, we get the probability distribution
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}=(p_j)_{1\leq j\leq p}\)</span>
over <span class="math inline">\(\{1, \ldots, p\}\)</span>. One way to
interpret the notion of diversity is to measure how “random” <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> is. Indeed, if it is
concentrated on 1, for instance, with <span class="math inline">\(p_1\simeq 1\)</span>, then samples generated in an
i.i.d. manner from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> will
not be diverse, as they will mostly consist of the value 1. Then an
<em>entropy</em> is a rather natural diversity index. For instance, the
Shannon entropy <span class="math inline">\(H(\mathcal{P})=-\sum_{j}p_j\log p_j\)</span>
provides a good diversity index. Based on the principle outlined above,
the diversity of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> is the
number <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> such that the diversity
index of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> is equal to
the diversity index of the uniform distribution on <span class="math inline">\(\{1, \ldots, m\}\)</span>. It can be shown that
for the Shannon entropy, the diversity of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\exp(H(\mathcal{P}))\)</span>. This holds also for
all the Rényi entropies.</p>
<p>Notice that in <code><a href="../reference/diversity.html">diversity()</a></code> the diversities are computed
according to the incoming flows, i.e., not using the <span class="math inline">\((Z_j)_{1\leq j\leq p}\)</span> but rather the
<span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> defined above by <span class="math display">\[
\forall j,\  D_j=\sum_{i=1}^nY_{ij}.
\]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="self-exchange-configurations">Self-Exchange Configurations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#self-exchange-configurations"></a>
</h2>
<p>In the general case, exchanges in spatial interaction models follow a
bipartite scheme: production locations send their productions to
destination locations. These locations are two distinct sets. The
non-bipartite case is when production and destination locations are
identical. This does not change anything in the definition of the models
(static and dynamic), but new tools can be defined specifically for this
particular case.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="location-domination-and-terminals">Location Domination and Terminals<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#location-domination-and-terminals"></a>
</h3>
<p>These tools are based on notions proposed by J. D. Nystuen and M. F.
Dacey (1961). As any location is both a production and a destination
location, one can compare the outgoing flows to the incoming ones. In
particular, Nystuen and Dacey focus on the maximum output flow and on
the total incoming flow (the <span class="math inline">\((D_j)_{1\leq
j\leq p}\)</span>). More precisely, they define the importance of
location <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> and introduce the notion of
<em>domination</em>: a location <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
is <em>dominated</em> if its importance is smaller than the importance
of the location to which it is sending its largest flow. In
equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
D_k &lt; D_{\arg\max_{j} Y_{kj}}.
\]</span></p>
<p>A <em>terminal</em> is a location that is not dominated. Rihll and
Wilson (1991) propose a relaxed version in which a terminal is a
location that receives a total incoming flow larger than all its
individual outgoing flows. Thus, location <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is dominated according to this
definition if:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
D_k &lt; \max_{j}Y_{kj}.
\]</span></p>
<p>It is easy to see that a terminal in the Nystuen and Dacey definition
is also a terminal for Rihll and Wilson, but the reverse is false. The
functions <code><a href="../reference/terminals.html">terminals()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/is_terminal.html">is_terminal()</a></code>
compute the terminals according to either definition. In addition, the
number of terminals can be seen as a diversity measure and is thus
included in the definitions supported by <code><a href="../reference/diversity.html">diversity()</a></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="domination-graphs">Domination Graphs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#domination-graphs"></a>
</h3>
<p>In addition to extracting terminals from a non-bipartite model,
Nystuen and Dacey propose to analyse the so-called <em>nodal
structure</em> of the flows. It consists of the <em>nodal flows</em>,
i.e. the links between each non-terminal location and the location to
which it is sending its largest flow. This defines a graph on the
locations which is very sparse (it has <span class="math inline">\(p-t\)</span> edges, where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the number of locations and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> the number of terminals). The function
<code><a href="../reference/nd_graph.html">nd_graph()</a></code> computes this graph according to both terminal
definitions.</p>
