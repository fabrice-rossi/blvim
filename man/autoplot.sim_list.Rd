\arguments{
\item{object}{a collection of spatial interaction models, a \code{sim_list}}

\item{flows}{\code{"full"} (default),  \code{"destination"} or \code{"attractiveness"}, see
details.}

\item{with_names}{specifies whether the graphical representation includes
location names (\code{FALSE} by default)}

\item{with_positions}{specifies whether the graphical representation is based
on location positions (\code{FALSE} by default)}

\item{cut_off}{cut off limit for inclusion of a graphical primitive when
\code{with_positions = TRUE}. In the attractiveness or destination
representation, circles are removed when the corresponding upper quantile
value is below the cut off.}

\item{adjust_limits}{if \code{FALSE} (default value), the limits of the position
based graph are not adjusted after removing graphical primitives. This
eases comparison between graphical representations with different cut off
value. If \code{TRUE}, limits are adjusted to the data using the standard
ggplot2 behaviour.}

\item{with_labels}{if \code{FALSE} (default value) names are displayed using plain
texts. If \code{TRUE}, names are shown using labels.}

\item{qmin}{lower quantile, see details (default: 0.05)}

\item{qmax}{upper quantile, see details (default: 0.95)}

\item{normalisation}{when \code{flows="full"}, the flows can be reported without
normalisation (\code{normalisation="none"}) or they can be normalised, either to
sum to one for each origin location (\code{normalisation="origin"}, the default
value) or to sum to one globally (\code{normalisation="full"}).}

\description{
This function represents graphically the variability of the flows represented
by the spatial interaction models contained in a collection (a \code{sim_list}
object).
}
\details{
The graphical representation depends on the values of \code{flows} and
\code{with_positions}. It is based on the data frame representation produced by
\code{\link[=fortify.sim_list]{fortify.sim_list()}}. In all cases, the variations of the flows are
represented via quantiles of their distribution over the collection of
models. For instance, when \code{flows} is \code{"destination"}, the function computes
the quantiles of the incoming flows observed in the collection at each
destination. We consider three quantiles:
\itemize{
\item a lower quantile \code{qmin} defaulting to 0.05;
\item the median;
\item a upper quantile \code{qmax} defaulting to 0.95.
}

If \code{with_position} is \code{FALSE} (default value), the graphical representations
are "abstract". Depending on \code{flows} we have the following representations:
\itemize{
\item \code{"full"}: the function displays the quantiles over the collection of
models of the flows using nested squares (\code{\link[=flows]{flows()}}). The graph is organised
as matrix with origin locations on rows and destination locations on columns.
At each row and column intersection, three nested squares represent
respectively the lower quantile, the median and the upper quantile of the
distribution of the flows between the corresponding origin and destination
locations over the collection of models. The median square borders are
thicker than the other two squares. The area of each square is proportional
to the represented value.
\item \code{"destination"}: the function displays the quantiles over the collection
of models of the incoming flows for each destination location (using
\code{\link[=destination_flow]{destination_flow()}}). Quantiles are represented using
\code{\link[ggplot2:geom_linerange]{ggplot2::geom_crossbar()}}: each location is represented by a rectangle that
spans from its lower quantile to its upper quantile. An intermediate thicker
bar represents the median quantile.
\item \code{"attractiveness"}: the function displays the quantiles over the
collection of models of the attractiveness of each destination location (as
given by \code{\link[=attractiveness]{attractiveness()}}). The graphical representation is the same as for
\code{"destination"}. This is interesting for dynamic models where those values
are updated during the iterations (see \code{\link[=blvim]{blvim()}} for details). When the
calculation has converged (see \code{\link[=sim_converged]{sim_converged()}}), both \code{"destination"} and
\code{"attractiveness"} graphics should be almost identical.
}

When the \code{with_names} parameter is \code{TRUE}, the location names
(\code{\link[=location_names]{location_names()}}) are used to label the axis of the graphical
representation. If names are not specified, they are replaced by indexes.

When the \code{with_positions} parameter is \code{TRUE}, the location positions
(\code{\link[=location_positions]{location_positions()}}) are used to produce more "geographically informed"
representations. Notice that if no positions are known for the locations, the
use of \code{with_positions = TRUE} is an error. Moreover, \code{flows = "full"} is not
supported: the function will issue a warning and revert to the position free
representation if this value is used.

The representations for \code{flows="destination"} and \code{flows="attractiveness"}
are based on the same principle. Each destination location is represented by
a collection of three nested circles centred on the corresponding location
position, representing respectively the lower quantile, the median and the
upper quantile of the incoming flows or of the attractivenesses. The
diameters of the circles are proportional to the quantities they represent.
The border ot the median circle is thicker than the ones of the other
circles.

When both \code{with_positions} and \code{with_names} are \code{TRUE}, the names of the
destinations are added to the graphical representation. If \code{with_labels} is
\code{TRUE} the names are represented as labels instead of plain texts (see
\code{\link[ggplot2:geom_text]{ggplot2::geom_label()}}). If the \code{ggrepel} package is installed, its
functions are used instead of \code{ggplot2} native functions.
