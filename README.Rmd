`blvim` implements A. Wilson's Boltzmann–Lotka–Volterra (BLV) interaction model. 
The model is described in 
[Wilson, A. (2008), "Boltzmann, Lotka and Volterra and spatial structural evolution: an integrated methodology for some dynamical systems", J. R. Soc. Interface.5865–871](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2007.1288)

## Installation

You can install the development version of blvim from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("fabrice-rossi/blvim")
```
